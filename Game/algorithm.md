# Algorithm

1. Define a module named deposit() to get the user input that gets the deposit from the user with basic constraints to obtain a valid value.

2. Declare a global variable named **MAX_LINES** and define another method named **get_number_of_lines()** to get the input of no.of lines, so that the amount that gets involved in the bet gets multiplied with this input.

3. Declare 2 global variables named **MAX_BET AND MIN_BET** Define another method named **get_bet()** to get the input of amount which the user is going to bet on each line with necessary constraints.

4. Now define a **main()** method to call the above functions to process the fundamental inputs of the game.

5. To run the slot machine Import a module named **random**, because we need to generate the slot machine values in a random manner.
